NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::LogContextual - Set up Log::Contextual for use with
    Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Contextual is a context driven Logging facility that aims to
    provide cross-cutting log mechanisms.

    However, the way it works means that if nobody starts an initial
    'set_logger' call, the logs may go nowhere. Or something.

    I don't really understand it all fully, so I'm implementing what I know
    to learn it better.

TL;DR
        [LogContextual] 
        ; plugins with Log::Contextual in them should work nao

CAVEATS
    *   NO PREFIXES

        At this time, The nice pretty [Foo/Bar] prefix from
        "$plugin->plugin_name" is not supported.

        We're not sure if it ever will, it probably will, but the code makes
        my head hurt at present.

        Was better to release something, albeit feature incomplete, than to
        release nothing at all.
