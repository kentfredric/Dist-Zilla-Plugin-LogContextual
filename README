NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::LogContextual - Set up Log::Contextual for use with
    Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Contextual is a context driven Logging facility that aims to
    provide cross-cutting log mechanisms.

    However, the way it works means that if nobody starts an initial
    'set_logger' call, the logs may go nowhere. Or something.

    I don't really understand it all fully, so I'm implementing what I know
    to learn it better.

TL;DR
        [LogContextual] 
        ; plugins with Log::Contextual in them should work nao
